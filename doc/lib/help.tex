: Matthieu Petit

This library extracts information about models such as,

\begin{itemize}
    \item what are the valid task of the model
    \item what options does a particular task predicate take/require
    \item what is the format of the file produced by the task
    \item what input files and their formats does each task assume
\end{itemize}

    \tag{bug}
: (cth) I think this help library has become slightly outdated by recent developments in the framework. It should be updated!
