\section{script.pl -- The LoSt scripting language}

\label{sec:script}

This is the library for running scripts in the LoSt script language.

The basic way of running a script is to consult the script from PRISM
and the call \predref{run}{1} to invoke the goal of interest in the script.\vspace{0.7cm}

\begin{description}
    \predicate[private]{view}{1}{+Goal}
Launch external viewer to view the file corresponding to script goal: \arg{Goal}. Currently, just launches vim.
If the goal has not yet been run and the result is not yet available on file, then the goal will be run
before launching the file viewer.

    \predicate{run}{1}{+Goal}
Will run the script goal \arg{Goal} with the sequential semantics (one task/process at a time). 

    \predicate{run_parallel}{1}{+Goal}
Runs the \arg{Goal} using the parallel semantics.
