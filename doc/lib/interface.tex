Launch a prism process that first consults
the file named by \arg{PrismPrologFile} and then

This is used by the CLC gui

    \predicate[private]{list_lost_models}{1}{-Models}
Compute the list of models available

    \predicate[private]{lost_model_input_formats_to_file}{3}{+Model, +Goal, +OutputFile}
