\begin{description}
    \predicate{dna_seq_complement}{2}{+NucleotideSequence, -ReverseComplementedNucleotideSequence}
Complement the DNA sequence given in the list \arg{NucleotideSequence} yield its complement as the list \arg{ReverseComplementedNucleotideSequence}

    \predicate{dna_complement}{2}{?Base, ?Complement}
Relation that maps bases to their complements

    \predicate{dna_translate}{3}{+Genecode, ?DNASequence, ?AminoAcids}

or vice versa: Produce all possible DNA sequences for
a given amino acids sequence
