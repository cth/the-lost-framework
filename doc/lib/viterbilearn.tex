\begin{description}
    \predicate{viterbi_learn_file}{1}{+File}
Learns the parameters of a PRISM program from the observed goals
supplied in \arg{File}

    \predicate{viterbi_learn_file_count_only}{1}{+File}
Does empirical frequency counting of the MSWs involved
in the viterbi path of the observed goals in \arg{File} 

    \predicate{viterbi_learn_stream}{1}{+Stream}
Does empirical frequency counting of the MSWs involved
in the viterbi path of the observed goals in \arg{Stream} 

    \predicate{viterbi_learn}{1}{+ListOfGoals}
Does empirical frequency counting of the MSWs involved
in the viterbi path of the observed goals in \arg{ListOfGoals} 

    \predicate{viterbi_learn_term}{1}{+G}
Does empirical frequency counting of the MSWs involved
in the viterbi path of the observed goal \arg{G}

    \predicate{count_msw}{1}{+MSW}
increment the counter for \arg{MSW} 

    \predicate{clear_counters}{0}{}
reset all MSW counts to zero 

    \predicate{merge_counts_files}{1}{+FileList}
Takes a \arg{FileList} and reads MSW counts from each of the files
in the list. The counts read are added to the allready existing
counts, effectively summing the counts of all the files.

    \predicate{load_counts_file}{1}{+CountsFile}

    \predicate{add_pseudo_counts}{0}{}
Add a small pseudo count for each possible mws outcome

    \predicate{set_switches_from_counts}{0}{}
Set the probabilities of all switches using recorded counts

    \predicate{set_switches_from_couns}{1}{+Switch}
Set the probability for outcome from \arg{Switch} to the normalized value
of the observed counts for the switch

    \predicate{count_list_from_outcome_list}{3}{+Switch, +OutcomesList, -CountList}
produce a list of counts for outcome of \arg{Switch} 

    \predicate{compute_frequencies_from_counts}{3}{+Total, +CountList, +FreqList}
Compute the relative frequency of each outcome 
\end{description}
