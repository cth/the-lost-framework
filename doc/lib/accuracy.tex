\begin{description}
    \predicate{accuracy_stats}{5}{+RefFunctor, +PredFunctor, +Start, +End, +OutputFile}
Overall report the accuracy statistics for a particular predictor.

    \predicate{sensivity}{3}{+TP, +TN, -SN}
Computation of the sensity

\begin{code}
SN is TP/(TP+FN) or undefined
\end{code}

    \predicate{specificity}{3}{+TP, +FP, -SP}
Computation of the specificity

\begin{code}
SP is TP/(TP+FN) or undefined
\end{code}

    \predicate{specificity_traditional}{3}{+TN, +FP, -SP}
Computation of the tradional specificity

\begin{code}
SP is TN / (TN + FP)
\end{code}

    \predicate{correlation_coefficient}{5}{+TP, +FP, +TN, +FN, -CC}
Computation of correlation coefficient

Note: 0.0 is add to make numbers floats instead of ints.
Ints are not allowed to be larger than 268435455 in bprolog which
would otherwise cause this predicate to overflow for realistic data sizes

    \predicate{simple_matching_coefficient}{5}{+TP, +FP, +TN, +FN, -SMC}
Computation of the simple matching coefficient

\begin{code}
SMC is (TP + TN) / (TP + FN + FP + TN)
\end{code}

    \predicate{average_conditional_probability}{5}{+TP, +FP, +TN, +FN, -ACP}
Computation of the average condtional probability

    \predicate{approximate_correlation}{5}{+TP, +FP, +TN, +FN, -AC}
Computation of the average correlation

    \predicate{gene_difficulty_score}{3}{+NumGeneFinders, +NumFoundGene, -DifficultyScore}
\arg{DifficultyScore} is computed given the following formula

\begin{code}
DifficultyScore is 1 - ( NumFoundGene / NumGeneFinders)
\end{code}

    \predicate{report_nstats}{4}{+ReferenceAnnotFunctor, +PredictionAnnotFunctor, +Start, +End}
This predicate computes and prints in the standart output: True Positive,
True Negative, False Positive, False Negative
If I am right, \arg{Start} and \arg{End} specified a sub-part of the genome where this
computation is performed

    \predicate{nucleotide_level_accuracy_counts}{8}{+Begin, +End, +RefAnnot, +PredAnnot, -TP, -FP, -TN, -FN}
Compute some statistics at the nucleotide level.

    \predicate{strand}{1}{+Strand}
\arg{Strand} in \{+,-\}

    \predicate{reading_frame}{1}{+Frame}
\arg{Frame} in \{1,2,3\}
\end{description}
