  abstract =	"This document introduces PlDoc, a literate programming
		 system for Prolog. Starting point for PlDoc was minimal
		 distraction from the programming task and maximal
		 immediate reward, attempting to seduce the programmer
		 to use the system. Minimal distraction is achieved
		 using structured comments that are as closely as
		 possible related to common Prolog documentation
		 practices. Immediate reward is provided by a web
		 interface powered from the Prolog development
		 environment that integrates searching and browsing
		 application and system documentation. When accessed
		 from localhost, it is possible to go from documentation
		 shown in a browser to the source code displayed in the
		 user's editor of choice.",
