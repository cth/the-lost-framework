This is an wrapper model to the external program PPFold. 

Given a list of sequences text(prolog(ranges(gene))) it will try to fold each of them.

The input file is expected to contain the actual sequence of the range as an extra field, but
the functor used to specify the field is given as an option. 

In the output file, genes/ranges will have two new extra fields: =|folding|= which is a list representing
the folding for each position in the sequence (using characters '<', '>', and '.') 
and =|energy|= which is the free energy of the folding.  

To setup integration with PPFold you may need to alter the configuration file =|config.pl|= which 
specifies where Java and PPFold are installed:

==
ppfold_jar('/opt/ppfold/PPfold-v2-0.jar').
java('/usr/bin/java').
==
