This is a simple gene finder based on codon preference. 
It is a two-state Hidden Markov Model that emit the codons of a sequence from either a coding state or a non-coding state.
Once a transition to a coding state has occurred, the model stays in the coding state until the end state, as can be observed
from the following transitions.

==
values(trans('c'),['c','end']).
values(trans('n'),['c','n','end']).
==

The following assumes the following about input sequences:
(1) The sequence length is a multiple of three (since codons are emitted)
(2) The "codingness" of the sequence follows the regular expression pattern: "n\*c\*" 

The gene finder was written by Ole, based on an earlier gene finder by Matthieu. 
Part of "the infrastructure" later rewritten by Christian.
