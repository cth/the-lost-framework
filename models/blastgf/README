Blast based gene finder.

This gene finder predicts genes based on blast hits.

This is based on Oles (now defunct it seeems) chunk_aa_conservtion model, but considerably rewritten by Christian Theil Have.
The =|blastgf|= model only contains the probabilistic HMM and prism model related to prediction of 
genes based on blast matches and more mundane tasks like preprocessing, blast xml parsing, running of 
blast have been omitted from this model.

FIXME: More documentation needs to be done.
