      <title>The European Rock Tour Problem (Also known as the Travelling salesman problem)</title>
      <p>An ageing rock band was planning its (hopefully) last european tour. They were planning to visite 15 european cities: Barcelona, Berlin, Brussels, Dublin, Hamburg, Kiev, London, Madrid, Milan, Moscow, Munich, Paris, Rome, Vienna, and  Warsaw.</p>
	<p><img src="images/europe2.png" alt="European Tour" /></p>
      <p>They start planning the trip, when they realize that they could save a lot of money, if they ordered the cities to minimize the traveling cost. So they decided to try all possible combinations. The sat in front of the computer, visited they favorite traveling site, and started typing. 53 hours and several liters of coffee later, they realized it was a little bit more complicated than what they expected. They called their drummer (who was on vacations) and explained the problem to him. Fortunately, their drummer had a Master in Computer Science degree.</p>
	<p><em><strong>Drummer</strong> – Boys, if you continue, you will have to try 1,307,674,368,000 combinations. You are in front of a NP Problem.</em>
</p>
<p><em><strong>Band member #1</strong> – Oh man! So it is going to take us all day!</em>
</p>
<p><em><strong>Band member #2</strong> – And maybe more, 'cause this internet connection sucks...</em>
</p>
<p><em><strong>Drummer</strong> – err... yes, it would take a while. But don't worry, I am sure we can get to a good solution using stochastic search algorithms applied to this problem..</em>
</p>
<p><em><strong>Band</strong> – (Silence)</em>
</p>
<p><em><strong>Drummer</strong> – .. that is, we are going to move from solution to solution in the space of candidate solutions, using techniques similar to what nature use for evolution, these are known as genetic algorithms.</em>
</p>
<p><em><strong>Band</strong> – (Silence)</em>
</p>
<p><em><strong>Drummer</strong> - ... What I mean is, we will pick some of them randomly, leave the ugly ones behind, and mate with the good looking ones...</em>
</p>
<p><em><strong>Band</strong> – YEAH! THAT'S THE MAN! LET'S DO IT!</em>
</p>
<p>I forgot to tell another restriction of this problem: This band is really bad (What did you expect? Their drummer is a computer geek!) so once they visited a city, they cannot go back there.

    <section id="Introduction">
      <title>Introduction to Genetics Algorithms in Ruby</title>
      <p>A Genetic Algorithm is a particular class of evolutionary algorithm and stochastic search.
        It aims to find the best possible solution in a solution domain, by selecting a simple
        set of solutions (chosed randomly or with a simple heuristic), and making it "evolve".        
      </p>
      <p>It works based on the following pseudocode:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Choose initial population</li>
		<li>Evaluate the fitness of each individual in the population</li>
		<li>Repeat as many times as generations we allow
			<ol>
				<li>Select randomly best-ranking individuals to reproduce</li>
				<li>Breed new generation through crossover and mutation (genetic operations) and give birth to offspring</li>
				<li>Evaluate the individual fitnesses of the offspring</li>
				<li>Replace worst ranked part of population with offspring</li>
			</ol>

<section id="chromosome-impl">
      <title>Implementation of Chromosome class for the Travelling salesman problem</title>
      <p>In AI4R, the GeneticAlgorithm module implements the GeneticSearch and Chromosome classes. 
        GeneticSearch is a generic class, and can be used to solved any kind of problems. 
        The GeneticSearch class performs a stochastic search following the algorithm mentioned in the 
        previous section.
      </p>
	<p>
    However, the Chromosome class implementation is problem specific.
    Ai4r built-in Chromosomeclass was designed to model the 
    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traveling_salesman_problem" title="Link to Wikipedia">
      Travelling salesman problem.
    </a> 
    You have to provide a matrix with the cost of traveling from one point to another 
    (array of arrays of float values). 
    If you want to solve other type of problem, you will have to modify the Chromosome class, 
    by overwriting its fitness, reproduce, and mutate functions, to model you specific problem.
  </p>
	<section id="chromosome-impl-data">
      		<title>Data representation</title>
		<p>Each chromosome must represent a posible solution for the problem. This class conatins an array
		with the list of visited nodes (cities of the tour). The size of the tour is obtained automatically from the traveling costs matrix. You have to assign the costs matrix BEFORE you run the genetic search. The following costs matrix could be used to solve the problem with only 3 cities:</p>

</source>
    	</section>
	<section id="chromosome-impl-fitness">
      		<title>Fitness function</title>
		<p>The fitness function quantifies the optimality of a solution (that is, a chromosome) in a genetic algorithm so that that particular chromosome may be ranked against all the other chromosomes.
Optimal chromosomes, or at least chromosomes which are more optimal, are allowed to breed and mix their datasets by any of several techniques, producing a new generation that will (hopefully) be even better.</p>
		<p>The fitness function will return the complete tour cost represented by the chromosome, multiplied by -1.
For example:</p>

<source>
<![CDATA[
data_set = [	[ 0, 10, 5],
		[ 6,  0, 4],
		[25,  4, 0]
	]
Ai4r::GeneticAlgorithm::Chromosome.set_cost_matrix(data_set)
chromosome = Ai4r::GeneticAlgorithm::Chromosome.new([0, 2, 1])
chromosome.fitness
	# => -9
]]>
</source>
<p>That is: From 0 to 2 costs 5. From 2 to 1 costs 4. Total cost is 9.</p>

	<section id="chromosome-impl-reproduce">
      		<title>Reproduce function</title>
		<p>Reproduction is used to vary the programming of a chromosome or chromosomes from one generation to the next. There are several ways to combine two chromosomes: One-point crossover, Two-point crossover, "Cut and splice", edge recombination, and more. The method is usually dependant of the problem domain. In this case, we have implemented edge recombination, wich is the most used reproduction algorithm for the Travelling salesman problem. The edge recombination operator (ERO) is an operator that creates a path that is similar to a set of existing paths (parents) by looking at the edges rather than the vertices.</p>

	<section id="chromosome-impl-mutation">
      		<title>Mutation function</title>
		<p>Mutation funtion will be called fro every member of the population, on each generations. But you do not want to mutate your chromosomes every time, specialy if the are very fit. This is how it is currently implemented: With a probabilty of changing inversely proportional to its fitness, we swap 2 consecutive random nodes.</p>

	<p>Selection is the stage of a genetic algorithm in which individual genomes are chosen from a population for later breeding. There are several generic selection algorithms, such as tournament selection and roulette wheel selection. We implemented the latest.</p>
<ol>
<li>The fitness function is evaluated for each individual, providing fitness values</li>
<li>The population is sorted by descending fitness values.</li>
<li>The fitness values ar then normalized. (Highest fitness gets 1, lowest fitness gets 0). The normalized value is stored in the "normalized_fitness" attribute of the chromosomes.</li>
<li> A random number R is chosen. R is between 0 and the accumulated normalized value (all the normalized fitness values added togheter).</li>
<li>The selected individual is the first one whose accumulated normalized value (its is normalized value plus the normalized values of the chromosomes prior it) greater than R.</li>
<li>We repeat steps 4 and 5, 2/3 times the population size.</li>
