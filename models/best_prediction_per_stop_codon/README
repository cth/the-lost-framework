This is a simple model for excluding several overlapping predictions 
with the same stop-codon. Instead,  given a set of predictions with
scores (as extra field) the model selects the best scoring gene prediction
for each stop codon.
I.e. the final set of predictions will only contain one prediction per
stop codon.

The functor of the extra field that contains the score of the prediction, needs 
to be specified using an option.
