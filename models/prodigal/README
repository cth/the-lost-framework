Wrapper for the Prodigal gene finder.

The model allows running the gene finder and parsing reports produced by the gene finder.

To run Prodigal via this model you must have the Prodigal software installed locally.
After installation, alter the file =|config.pl|= to point to the executable binary of Prodigal, e.g. 
==
prodigal_config(prodigal_binary, '/opt/genefinders/prodigal/prodigal.v2_50.linux').
==
